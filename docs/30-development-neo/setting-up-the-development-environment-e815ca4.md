Before you can start developing your application, you need to download and set up the necessary tools, SAP BTP Tools, and SDK.

SAP BTP Tools, SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment, SAP JVM, and the Cloud Connector, can be downloaded from the [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/) page.

For more information on each step of the set up procedure, open the relevant page from the structure.



## Procedure

1.  For Java applications, choose between three types of SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment.

    For more information, see [Install the SAP BTP SDK for Neo Environment](install-the-sap-btp-sdk-for-neo-environment-7613843.md).

2.  SAP JVM is the Java runtime used in SAP BTP. It can be set as a default JRE for your local runtime.

    For instructions on how to install it, see [\(Optional\) Install SAP JVM](optional-install-sap-jvm-76137f4.md).

3.  To configure the Console Client, see [Set Up the Console Client](set-up-the-console-client-7613dee.md).
4.  If you need to establish a connection between on-demand applications in SAP BTP and existing on-premise systems, you can use the Cloud Connector.

    For more information, see [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).
