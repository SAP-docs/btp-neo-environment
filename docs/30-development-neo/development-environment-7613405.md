The SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment, on the other hand, contains everything you need to work with the platform, including a local server runtime and a set of command line tools. The command line capabilities allow modern build tools, such as Apache Maven, to be used to professionally produce Web applications for the cloud. The command line is particularly important for setting up and automating a headless continuous build and test process.
