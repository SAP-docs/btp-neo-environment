> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**



The SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment, on the other hand, contains everything you need to work with the platform, including a local server runtime and a set of command line tools. The command line capabilities allow modern build tools, such as Apache Maven, to be used to professionally produce Web applications for the cloud. The command line is particularly important for setting up and automating a headless continuous build and test process.
