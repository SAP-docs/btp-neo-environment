# Assign Roles Required for the SAP HANA XS Administration Tool

To work with the SAP HANA XS Administration Tool, add the required rules to your database user.



## Context

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**

The initial set of roles of your database user also contains the *sap.hana.xs.ide.roles::Developer* role, allowing you to work with the SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench, but not the SAP HANA XS Administration tool.

To be able to work with the SAP HANA XS Administration Tool `(https://<schema><subaccount>.<host>sap/hana/xs/admin/)`, you require the relevant *sap.hana.xs.admin.roles*. However, these are not included in the initial set of roles. To assign these roles to your database user, perform the following steps:



<a name="loioc006db57b3654c5fbcd9f6136b556c3d__steps_dns_yyd_ndb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Log on in with your user to one of the following tools:

    -   Use the Eclipse IDE and connect to your SAP HANA studio. For more information, see [Connect to SAP HANA Databases via the Eclipse IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/d4790b2de2f4429db6f3dff54e4d7b3a/Cloud/en-US/4efc124a0ccc42b3b502ad3a3908d23d.html "Connect to an SAP HANA single-container (XS) or tenant database system (MDC) using SAP HANA tools via the Eclipse IDE.") :arrow_upper_right:.
