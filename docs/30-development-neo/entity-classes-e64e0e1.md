# Entity Classes

To declare a class as an entity and define how that entity maps to the relevant database table, you can either decorate the Java object with metadata using Java annotations or denote it as an entity in the XML descriptor.

The Dali Java Persistence Tools, which are provided as part of the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, allow you to use a JPA diagram editor to create, edit, and display entities and their relationships \(your applicationâ€™s data model\) in a graphical environment.



## Example

The tutorial *Adding Application-Managed Persistence with JPA \(SDK for Java Web\)* defines the entity class `Person`, as shown in the following:

```

package com.sap.cloud.sample.persistence;
import javax.persistence.*;
@Entity
@Table(name = "T_PERSON")
@NamedQuery(name = "AllPersons", query = "select p from Person p")
public class Person {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private long id;
	@Basic
	private String FirstName;
	@Basic
	private String LastName;


```

-   The `Person` class has been annotated as an entity: @Entity.
-   The @Table annotation maps the entity to the database table `T_PERSON`.
-   The @NamedQuery annotation indicates that a static query has been created in the metadata. The name element of @NamedQuery gives the name of the query that will be used with the `createNamedQuery()` method, while the query element specifies the actual query.
-   The definition of the field serving as the unique identifier of the entity has been annotated with @Id, indicating it is the primary key in the database. Its value is generated automatically \(@GeneratedValue\).
