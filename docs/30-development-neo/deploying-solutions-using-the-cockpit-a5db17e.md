By using the cockpit you can provision a solution using one of the following ways:

-   [Deploy a Standard Solution](deploy-a-standard-solution-fea07de.md)- The solution is deployed in the current subaccount and subscription to it is not possible.
-   [Deploy a Provided Solution](deploy-a-provided-solution-8f48815.md)- The solution is deployed in the current subaccount, but is provided for subscription to another subaccount.
-   [Subscribe to a Solution Available for Subscription](subscribe-to-a-solution-available-for-subscription-bd7602e.md)- The current subaccount is entitled to subscribe to a solution that has been provided by another subaccount.
