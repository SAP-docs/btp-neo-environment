# Deploy on the Cloud with the Console Client

Deploying an application publishes it to SAP BTP. During deploy, you can define various specifics of the deployed application using the deploy command optional parameters.

## Prerequisites

-   You have downloaded and configured SAP BTP console client. For more information, see [Set Up the Console Client](set-up-the-console-client-7613dee.md)
-   Depending on your subaccount type, deploy the application on the respective region host. For more information, see [Regions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html "You can deploy applications in different regions. Each region represents a geographical location (for example, Europe, US East) where applications, data, or services are hosted.") :arrow_upper_right:

> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on **December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
>

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**



## Procedure

1.  In the opened command line console, execute `neo deploy` command with the appropriate parameters.

    You can define the parameters of commands directly in the command line as in the example below, or in the properties file. For more information, see [Using the Console Client](../50-administration-and-ops-neo/using-the-console-client-8900b22.md).

2.  Enter your password if requested.

3.  Press ENTER and deployment of your application will start. If deployment fails, check if you have defined the parameters correctly.

    > ### Note:  
    > The size of an application deployed on SAP BTP can be up to 1.5 GB. If the application is packaged as a WAR file, the size of the unzipped content is taken into account.




## Example

```
neo deploy --host <host> --account <subaccount_name> --application <application_name> --source samples/deploy_war/example.war --user <email_or_user>  
```

## Next Steps

To make your deployed application available for requests, you need to start it by executing the `neo start` command.

Then, you can manage the application lifecycle \(check the status; stop; restart; undeploy\) using dedicated console client commands.
