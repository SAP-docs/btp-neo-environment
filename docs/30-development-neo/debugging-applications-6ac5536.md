# Debugging Applications

After you have created a Web application and tested it locally, you may want to inspect its runtime behavior and state by debugging the application in SAP BTP.



## Context

> ### Remember:  
> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on **December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
> 
> For more information, see SAP Note [3351844](https://me.sap.com/notes/3351844).

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/sap-business-technology-platform?version=Cloud) .**

The debugger enables you to detect and diagnose errors in your application. It allows you to control the execution of your program by setting breakpoints, suspending threads, stepping through the code, and examining the contents of the variables. You can debug a servlet or a JSP file on a SAP BTP server without losing the state of your application.

> ### Note:  
> Currently, it is only possible to debug Web applications in SAP BTP that have exactly one application process \(node\).
