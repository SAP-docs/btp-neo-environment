> ### Note:  
> This feature is only available for SAP HANA XS applications in single container SAP HANA systems. For SAP HANA XS applications in SAP HANA tenant database systems, use SAP Web IDE or SAP HANA cockpit to manage your applications.



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to a subaccount. For more information, see [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html "Learn how to navigate to your global accounts, directories, and subaccounts in the SAP BTP cockpit.") :arrow_upper_right:.

2.  Choose *Applications* \> *HANA XS Applications*.

3.  In the *HANA XS Applications* table, click the application URL link to launch the application.

    > ### Note:  
    > If an HTTP status 404 \(not found\) error is shown, bear in mind that the cockpit displays only the root of an applicationâ€™s URL path. This means that you might have to either:
    > 
    > -   Add the application name to the URL address in the browser, for example, `hello.xsjs`.
    > 
    > -   Use an `index.html` file, which is the default setting for the file displayed when the package is accessed without specifying a file name in the URL.
    > 
    > -   Override the above default setting by specifying the *default\_file* keyword in the `.xsaccess` file, for example:
    > 
    >     ```json
    >     {
    >     "exposed" : true,
    >     "default_file": "hello.xsjs"
    >     }
    >     ```
