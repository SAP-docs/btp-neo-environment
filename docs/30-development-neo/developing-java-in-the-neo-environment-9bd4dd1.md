# Developing Java in the Neo Environment

SAP BTP enables you to develop, deploy and use Java applications in a cloud environment. Applications run on a runtime container where they can use the platform services APIs and Java EE APIs according to standard patterns.

> ### Remember:  
> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on **December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
