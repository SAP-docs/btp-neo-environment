## Context

> ### Remember:  
> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on **December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
> 
> For more information, see SAP Note [3351844](https://me.sap.com/notes/3351844).

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment.

> ### Note:  
> -   Some parts of the solution might be shared and used by other entities within the SAP BTP. Such parts of the solution have to be removed manually.
> -   SAP SuccessFactors roles are not deleted.
> -   Custom application destinations and subaccount destinations are also deleted.
> -   Deleted solutions and their components cannot be restored.
> -   Currently, deleting a solution that has been provided for subscription is not automated. Subaccounts consuming your provided solutions have to delete their subscribed solutions before you delete that solution from your subaccount.
> -   If the solution has been provided to you for subscription from a provider subaccount, your entitlement is not deleted. You will be able to subscribe again to the provided solution.

To delete a solution from your subaccount, proceed as described below.

## Procedure

1.  In the cockpit, choose *Solutions* in the navigation area.

2.  In the solution list, select the tile of the solution you want to undeploy, and afterward choose *Delete*. As a result, the *Delete a Solution* dialog appears.

3.  Optionally, you can perform the following:

    1.  Deselect the *Delete data source bindings* checkbox.

        > ### Note:  
        > If the *Delete data source* checkbox is selected, any deployed database binding will be deleted. Note that your database credentials will not be removed from your database and can be used again.

    2.  Select the *Ignore solution component deletion errors* checkbox.

        > ### Note:  
        > If set, any errors during deletion that are external to SAP BTP \(for example, a SuccessFactors system\) are ignored.
        > 
        > Typical use case is to be able to delete a solution that is linked to a now nonexistent external system. Then, if the *Ignore solution component deletion errors* checkbox is not selected, the deletion process will fail with an error. When the *Ignore solution component deletion errors* is selected the deletion process will ignore the error and continue.

        > ### Note:  
        > If the *Ignore solution component deletion errors* checkbox is selected and an error that originates from an external to SAP BTP instance occurs, it will be ignored. As a result all the data stored in the SAP BTP for that solution will be deleted. However, external systems might still contain some data that is not deleted.


4.  Select the *Confirm solution deletion* checkbox, and choose *Delete*.

    The solution deletion dialog remains on the screen during the process. –ê confirmation appears when the deletion is completed.

    If you close the dialog while the process is running, you can open it again by choosing *Check Progress* of the corresponding operation, located in the *Ongoing Operations* table in the solution overview page.
