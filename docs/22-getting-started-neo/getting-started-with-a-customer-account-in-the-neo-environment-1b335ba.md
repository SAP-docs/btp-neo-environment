## 2. Setting Up Your Account Model

After you've received your logon data by email, create subaccounts in your global account. This allows you to further break down your account model and structure it according to your business needs. See [Create a Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/05280a123d3044ae97457a25b3013918.html "Create subaccounts in your global account using the SAP BTP cockpit.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## 3. Configuring Your Environment

1.  Since you need to use the cockpit to configure your environment, it's important you understand how you can navigate to your global account and subaccounts. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html "Learn how to navigate to your global accounts and subaccounts in the SAP BTP cockpit.") :arrow_upper_right:.

2.  It's time to think about member management. You can add members to subaccounts and assign different roles to those members. For more information, see [Add Members to Your Neo Subaccount](../50-administration-and-ops-neo/add-members-to-your-neo-subaccount-a253570.md). For more information about roles, see [Managing Member Authorizations in the Neo Environment](../50-administration-and-ops-neo/managing-member-authorizations-in-the-neo-environment-a1ab5c4.md).

3.  Before you can start using resources such as application runtimes, you need to manage your entitlements and add quotas to your subaccounts. See [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts](../50-administration-and-ops-neo/configure-entitlements-and-quotas-for-subaccounts-c90f3d5.md). To learn more about entitlements and quotas, see [Managing Entitlements and Quotas Using the Cockpit](../50-administration-and-ops-neo/managing-entitlements-and-quotas-using-the-cockpit-23e9ad3.md).
