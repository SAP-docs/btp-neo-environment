# Managing API Credentials for Calling REST APIs of SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to manage API credentials, which enable you to access the REST APIs of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service.

If you want to access the REST APIs of SAP Authorization and Trust Management service in multi-environment subaccounts, global accounts, or directories, you must provide the required API credentials. One main use case is for customers who want to provision users including their authorizations, for example into a global account or a directory. They need credentials \(with a client ID\) for provisioning of users, especially when using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning.

The API credentials are only passed on when they are created. They can't be retrieved later. If lost, new credentials must be generated.

See [Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/517895a9612241259d6941dbf9ad81cb.html "The syntax required to set the properties and values defined in the xs-security.json application security descriptor file.") :arrow_upper_right: for the credential types and [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/authtrustmgmnt/rest) for the APIs of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service.
