# Setting Entitlements Using the btp CLI

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to set entitlements to define the functionality or permissions available for users of global accounts, directories, and subaccounts.

> ### Tip:  
> By default, all commands are executed in the global account you're logged into. To change this to a directory or subaccount, use `btp target`. See [Set a Target for Subsequent Commands with btp target](set-a-target-for-subsequent-commands-with-btp-target-720645a.md).

> ### Restriction:  
> It is not possible to list the entitlements of a Neo subaccount with `btp list accounts/entitlements --subaccount <ID>`. You can, however, list the entitlements for a directory that includes Neo subaccounts with `btp list accounts/entitlements --directory <ID>`.
