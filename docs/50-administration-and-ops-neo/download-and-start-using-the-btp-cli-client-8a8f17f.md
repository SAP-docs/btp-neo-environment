# Download and Start Using the btp CLI Client

To use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\), you need to download the client first.



## Context

The client is available for 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:

-   Microsoft Windows \(amd64\)

-   Apple macOS \(amd64 and arm64\)

-   Linux \(amd64 and arm64\)


Each client version is supported for at least a year and most of the updates to the btp CLI don't require a new client installation, but are made available through the btp CLI server, so that you can use them in your installed version of the client. However, to make sure you don't miss any new features or security updates, we recommend to regularly update the client anyways.

In the [What's New for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/whats-new/cf0cb2cb149647329b5d02aa96303f56?Component=SAP%20BTP%20Command%20Line%20Interface&locale=en-US&version=Cloud) page on SAP Help Portal \(filtered for *SAP BTP Command Line Interface\)* we inform about new features, client releases, as well about client deprecations and discontinuations.



## Procedure

1.  Download the appropriate client for your operating system from [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud-btpcli) with the links in the table below. If you prefer using the command line or a script, you can use the curl command from the table below, which downloads and saves the latest client version to your computer and accepts the SAP Developer Agreement \(EULA\).

2.  Extract the client file from the tar.gz archive.

    Linux: Use the terminal to open the tar.gz file with `tar -xzf btp-cli-linux-amd64-latest.tar.gz`.

    macOS: Open the tar.gz file by double-clicking in.

    Windows: Use powershell or an external program, such as WinRar, to extract the tar.gz file. Tip: Once you've unpacked the executable, you can enter `cmd` or `powershell` in the address bar of the folder. This opens the command prompt or PowerShell in this folder. Or proceed with the next step in order to enable calling `btp` from any location on your system.

3.  Copy the client executable from the unpacked folder to a directory of your choice. We recommend the following, because it ensures that you can call `btp` system wide, i.e. that it is in your PATH:

    Linux: `/usr/local/bin`

    macOS: `/usr/local/bin`

    Windows: `C:/Users/<your-user>`

    In the Windows search, enter `Environment Variable` and open the *System Properties*. On the **Advanced** tab, open **Environment Variables**. Under **User Variables**, open the **Path** entry and add the file location of the btp.exe \(`C:\Users<your-user>`\).

4.  \(Optional\) If you have a proxy server configured in your environment, you need to specify its address and port as environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` to access SAP BTP. For example, `HTTPS_PROXY=https://my-https-proxy:1234`.

    The specified proxy server is then used for HTTPS requests, unless overridden by the `NO_PROXY` or `no_proxy`, environment variables, which define a comma-separated list of hosts to be excluded from proxying.

5.  Run `btp` in your terminal. Note that you need read and write permissions in the target folder to run this executable.

6.  Log in to your global account with `btp login` or `btp login --sso`. The login flow is interactive and will prompt for all required information. Note that you need to confirm the btp CLI server url \(`https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/`\) and, if you have more than one, select your global account. For details, see [Log in](log-in-e241b30.md).

7.  Once you're logged in, familiarize yourself with the btp CLI, for example with [How to Work with the btp CLI](how-to-work-with-the-btp-cli-11d9f67.md), [Command Syntax of the btp CLI](command-syntax-of-the-btp-cli-69606f4.md), or simply by trying out a few commands, such as the following:

    ```
    btp list accounts/subaccount
    ```

    ```
    btp list security/user
    ```

    ```
    btp get security/user "name@example.com"
    ```

    ```
    btp get accounts/global-account"
    ```

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can use the command autocompletion feature in the btp CLI to save keystrokes when entering command actions, group-object combinations, and their parameters in the command line. For more information, see [Enable Command Autocompletion](enable-command-autocompletion-46355fa.md).

8.  If youâ€™re going to work in a subaccount of this global account, consider setting the target to this subaccount using `btp target` and select the subaccount. See [Set a Target for Subsequent Commands with btp target](set-a-target-for-subsequent-commands-with-btp-target-720645a.md).

9.  To find out the current context, target, and version, use `btp`.
