# deploy

Deploying an application publishes it to SAP BTP. Use the optional parameters to make some specific configurations of the deployed application.

If you use enhanced disaster recovery, the application is deployed first on the specified region and then on the disaster recovery region.

The runtime version on which the application will be started and will run on the same version after a restart. Otherwise, by default, the application is started on the latest minor version \(of the same major version\) which is backward compatible and includes the latest corrections \(including security patches\), enhancements, and updates. Note that choosing this option does not affect already started application processes.

You can view the recommended versions by executing the *list-runtime-versions* command.

This is a mapping between the runtime and the respective version:

-   Java EE 7 Web Profile TomEE 7 corresponds to runtime **neo-javaee7-wp** and runtime version **1**. See [Java EE 7 Web Profile TomEE 7](../30-development-neo/java-ee-7-web-profile-tomee-7-f177a15.md).

## Example

Here are examples of some additional configurations. If your application is already started, stop it and start it again for the changes to take effect.

You can deploy an application on a host different from the default one by specifying the host parameter. For example, to use the region \(host\) located in the United States, execute:

```
neo deploy --host us1.hana.ondemand.com --account mysubaccount --application myapp --source samples/deploy_war/example.war 
--user mymail@example.com 
```

*Choose compute unit size*

To specify the compute unit size on which you want the application to run, use the `--size` parameter with one of the following values:

-   lite - Lite Edition
-   pro - Professional edition
-   prem - Premium edition
-   prem-plus - Premium Plus edition

Available sizes depend on your subaccount type and what options you have purchased. For trial accounts, only the Lite edition is available.

For more information, see [Compute Units](../30-development-neo/compute-units-7612fba.md).

For example, if you have an enterprise account and have purchased a package with Premium edition compute units, then you can run your application on a Premium compute unit size, by executing the following command:

```

neo deploy --size prem myapp.properties
```

*Set the context root of an application*

When deploying an application, name the WAR file with the desired context root.

For example, if you want to deploy your WAR in context root "/hello" then rename your WAR to hello.war.

If you want to deploy it in the "/" context root then rename your WAR to ROOT.war.

*Specify character encoding*

Using the`â€“uri-encoding` parameter, you can define the character encoding that will be used to decode the URI bytes on application request. For example, to use the UTF-8 encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set, execute

```

neo deploy --uri-encoding UTF-8 myapp.properties
```
