# Get Updates

We recommend updating the CLI client from time to time to ensure that you can always use all new features.



<a name="loioe92aa7859bc94a07a764f49c0437ead3__context_u1f_2kd_yjb"/>

## Context

Updating the btp CLI client is essentially replacing the old executable file with a newer version. The [What's New for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/whats-new/cf0cb2cb149647329b5d02aa96303f56?Component=SAP%20BTP%20Command%20Line%20Interface&locale=en-US&version=Cloud) page on SAP Help Portal announces new features and informs you if you need a client update to use them. In addition, the client itself displays a message if you need an update.

To find out the version of the CLI client you are using, run `btp --info` or simply `btp`.



## Procedure

1.  Get the latest version using the download links at: [https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/\#cloud-cpcli](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud-cpcli).

2.  Extract the client file \(for example: `btp.exe`\) and replace the old file with this new one.

3.  Work with the btp CLI as usual and enjoy the new features.
