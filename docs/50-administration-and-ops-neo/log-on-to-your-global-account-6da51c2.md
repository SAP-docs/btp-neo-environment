# Log On to Your Global Account

Use the SAP BTP cockpit to log on to your global account and start working in SAP BTP.



## Prerequisites

You have a user that is a global account administrator.

If you don't have a global account administrator or one isn't available, there is a workaround using SAP for Me.

For more information, see [2669325 - How to add a user as a Global Account administrator for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002669325).
