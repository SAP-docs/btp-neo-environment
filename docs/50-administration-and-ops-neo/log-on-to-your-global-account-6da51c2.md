## Context

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**

When your organization signs a contract for SAP BTP services, an e-mail is sent to the e-mail address specified in the contract. The e-mail message contains the link to log on to the system and the SAP Cloud Identity credentials \(user ID\) for the specified user. These credentials can also be used for sites such as the [SAP Store](https://www.sapstore.com/) or the [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/community.html).
