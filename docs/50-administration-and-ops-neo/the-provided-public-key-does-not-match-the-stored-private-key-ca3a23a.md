# The Provided Public Key Does Not Match the Stored Private Key

Learn why you are getting the error message ***The provided public key does not match the stored private key*** and what you can do to solve this problem.

You receive the ***\(!\) ERROR: The provided public key does not match the stored private key*** error message when the certificate you are trying to import and you have specified in the `--name` parameter of the [upload-domain-certificate](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/upload-domain-certificate) command does not match the already stored private key.

In general, you can choose to either:

-   \(Recommended by SAP\) Upload a certificate based on the CSR generated by the `generate-csr` command. See [generate-csr](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/generate-csr).

-   Upload your own certificate, but you must also use the `--key-location` parameter to upload the corresponding private key. See [upload-domain-certificate](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/upload-domain-certificate).
