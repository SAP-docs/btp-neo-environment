In the Neo environment, you can assign predefined roles to subaccount members, but you can also create custom platform roles. For more information, see [Manage Custom Platform Roles](manage-custom-platform-roles-ede5f72.md). Administrators can request S-user IDs on the SAP ONE Support Launchpad [Managing Member Authorizations in the Neo Environment](managing-member-authorizations-in-the-neo-environment-a1ab5c4.md).



## Procedure

1.  Choose the subaccount to which you'd like to add members.

2.  In the navigation area, choose *Members*.

    Administrators can request S-user IDs on the SAP ONE Support LaunchpadAll members currently assigned to the subaccount are shown in a list.

    > ### Note:  
    > The name of a member is shown only after he or she visits the subaccount for the first time.

3.  Choose *Add Members*.

4.  Enter one or more user IDs, separated by commas, spaces, semicolons, or line breaks.

    There is currently no user validation.

5.  Select the roles for the members and save your changes.

## Next Steps

-   To select or unselect roles for a member, choose ![](images/Edit_Icon_abfe424.png) \(Edit\). The changes you make to the member's roles take effect immediately.
-   You can enter a comment when editing user roles. This lets you track the reasons for subaccount membership and other important data. The comments are visible to all members.
-   You can send an e-mail to a member. This option appears only after the recipient visits the subaccount for the first time.
-   To remove all the roles of a member, choose *Delete* \(trashcan\). This also removes the member from the subaccount.
-   Choose the *History* button to view a list of changes to members \(for example, added or removed members, or changed role assignments\).
-   Use the filter to show only the members with the role you've selected.
