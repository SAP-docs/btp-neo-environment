# Managing Trust from SAP BTP to an Identity Authentication Tenant

SAP BTP supports identity federation. Its concept is to reuse the user bases of identity providers. To use a custom identity provider, your global account or subaccount in SAP BTP must have a trust relationship to the identity provider you want to use.

> ### Note:  
> We recommend that you always use SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication as a single identity provider for SAP BTP. If you use corporate identity providers, connect them to your Identity Authentication tenant, which then acts as a hub.

## Prerequisites

-   You have a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication.

    For more information, see [Tenant Model and Licensing](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9.html?version=Cloud) in the documentation for Identity Authentication.

-   The Identity Authentication tenant is associated with the customer IDs of the relevant global account of SAP BTP.

    For more information, see [**Reuse SAP Cloud Identity Services Tenants for Different Customer IDs**](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/reuse-sap-cloud-identity-services-tenants-for-different-customer-ids) in the documentation for Identity Authentication.

-   Make sure that the email addresses of all users in your identity provider are unique and correct.


> ### Note:  
> We recommend that you request your own Identity Authentication tenant \(see [Getting a Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9.html#getting-a-tenant)\).

## Managing Trust Configurations

To manage trust with your identity provider, use the following commands.

```
btp create security/trust --idp my-tenant --subaccount my-subaccount-id --name my-trust-configuration --description "My Trust Configuration"
```

See [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/cb1bc8f1bd5c482e891063960d7acd78.html "When setting up accounts you need to assign users. While we provide you with your first users to get you started, your organization has identity providers that you want to integrate.") :arrow_upper_right:.
