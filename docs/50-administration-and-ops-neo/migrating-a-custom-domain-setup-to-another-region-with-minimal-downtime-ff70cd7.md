# Migrating a Custom Domain Setup to Another Region with Minimal Downtime

Follow these steps to minimize the downtime when migrating a custom domain configuration between regions.



## Context

If you want to migrate your custom domain configuration from one region to another region and you want to minimize the amount of downtime, follow these steps:



## Procedure

1.  Configure a custom domain in the new global account as per the standard configuration steps described in [Configuring Custom Domains](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/configuring-custom-domains). Skip the Configure DNS step for now.

2.  Once you have completed the custom domain setup, switch the CNAME record in the DNS to point to the SSL host of the new global account. By doing this, you make sure that the custom domain starts working with the new setup.

    > ### Note:  
    > Keep in mind that some time is needed for the new DNS record to be updated worldwide.

3.  If the new custom domain setup is working fine one week after youâ€™ve switched the traffic to the new SSL host, you can completely remove the old setup provided that you no longer need that setup. To do that, execute these commands in the following order:

    1.  Remove the trusted CA configurations from the old SSL host, if any, with[set-ssl-host](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/set-ssl-host) and the `--ca-bundle` `<bundle_name>:none` parameter.

    2.  Unbind the domain certificate with [unbind-domain-certificate](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/unbind-domain-certificate).

    3.  Remove all custom domain mappings with [remove-custom-domain](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/remove-custom-domain).

    4.  Remove all certificates with [delete-domain-certificates](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/delete-domain-certificate) and trusted CAs with [remove-ca](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/remove-ca).

    5.  Remove the old SSL host with [delete-ssl-host](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/delete-ssl-host).


    If you encounter any problems, [report a case](https://me.sap.com/home) and assign it to the BC-NEO-INFR component.
