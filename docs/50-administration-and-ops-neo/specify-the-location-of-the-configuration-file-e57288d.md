# Specify the Location of the Configuration File

You can change the location of the configuration file by using the `--config` option or the environment variable.



## Context

Upon successful login, the btp CLI creates a configuration file \(`config.json`\) in the default location of your user config directory:

-   Microsoft Windows: <code>C:\Users\<i class="varname">&lt;username&gt;</i>\AppData\Roaming\SAP\btp\config.json</code>

-   Apple macOS ; `~/Library/Application Support/.btp/config.json`

-   Linux: `~/.config/.btp/config.json`


This folder serves as the working directory of the btp CLI, that is, itâ€™s necessary for its proper functioning, and is used with each command execution.

If you want the configuration file to be created in a different folder, you can use the `--config` option in your login command and then specify this location in each command call with this `--config` option.



## Procedure

1.  Specify the location of the configuration file with your login command:

    ```
    btp --config "<file path>" login
    ```

2.  Specify this location either with the `BTP_CLIENTCONFIG` environment variable, or use the `--config` option with each subsequent command call.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > btp --config "<file path>"
    > ```

    > ### Note:  
    > In version 2.14, the environment variable `BTP_CLIENTCONFIG` was introduced. If you use an older client version, you need to use `SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG`. Although the old one is kept, we recommend to switch to `BTP_CLIENTCONFIG`.




## Example

Let's assume you want to work in two subaccounts in parallel, using two terminals. For example, with the first terminal \(A\), you want to work in a subaccount with ID 1000, with the second terminal \(B\) you want to work in a subaccount with ID 2000, and you want to list the users in each subaccount.


<table>
<tr>

Terminal A

</th>

Terminal B

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

1. Log in to your global account using the default location of the configuration file:

```
btp login
```

Run all commands as usual. The btp CLI uses the default configuration file.

</td>
<td valign="top">

1. Log in to your global account using a different location of the configuration file:

```
btp --config "C:\my-cli-folder" login
```

Use this option with each command call.

2. Set the target to subaccount 1000:

```
btp target --subaccount 1000
```



</td>
<td valign="top">

2. Set the target to subaccount 2000:

```
btp --config "C:\my-cli-folder" target --subaccount 2000
```



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

3. List the users of subaccount 1000:

```
btp list security/user
```



</td>
<td valign="top">

3. List the users of subaccount 2000:

```
btp --config "C:\my-cli-folder" list security/user
```
