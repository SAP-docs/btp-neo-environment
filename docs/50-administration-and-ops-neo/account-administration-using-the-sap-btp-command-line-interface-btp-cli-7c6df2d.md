# Account Administration Using the SAP BTP Command Line Interface \(btp CLI\)

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) for account management tasks, such as creating or updating subaccounts and directories, and managing entitlements. It is an alternative to the SAP BTP cockpit for users who like to work in a terminal or want to automate operations using scripts.

The btp CLI offers convenient features for interactive use as well as for scripting: For the interactice user, there's login via SSO, command autocompletion, as well as several interactive commands with prompts. But all commands can also be run with parameters, and the command output can be set to json format, so the btp CLI is perfect for scripting.

If you want to use the btp CLI for scripting, we recommend to use the `--format json` option or to persistently set the output format to json with `btp set config --format json`. See [Change the Output Format to JSON](change-the-output-format-to-json-dcb85b7.md) and [Change Configuration Settings](change-configuration-settings-dba4eb6.md).

## How the btp CLI Works

![](images/Overview_of_CLI_for_SAP_BTP_3a71aa7.png)

You download the btp CLI client to your local desktop and access it through the shell of your operating system. The client then accesses all required platform services through its backend, the CLI server, where the command definitions are stored. The CLI server delegates authentication and authorization to the authorization server, and forwards trust to the platform services, which then take care of authorization at the execution of each command.
