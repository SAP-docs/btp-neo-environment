The End-to-End trace analysis consists of features for performing analyses throughout your entire technical landscape, so that you can isolate problematic components and identify root causes. You analyze a trace to check the distribution of the response time over the client, network, and server. As a result, the response time of each component involved in executing the request and the request path through the components are provided to you for detailed analysis.
