### Runtime requirements for SAP BTP

Requests passing through SAP BTP require `SAP-PASSPORT` as the HTTP header. For more information, see [Approving HTTP Headers](../30-development-neo/approving-http-headers-df89d9c.md). When you start your tracing from an HTML5 application, then the `SAP-PASSPORT` is generated and injected automatically for you.
