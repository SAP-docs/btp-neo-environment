# Working with External Resource Providers Using the btp CLI

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to get details, or to create or delete resource provider instances in a global account.

> ### Note:  
> The use of this functionality is subject to the availability of the supported non-SAP cloud vendors in your country or region.

Creating a resource provider instance allows your global account to connect to your provider account on a non-SAP cloud vendor. Through this channel, you can then consume remote service resources that you already own and which are supported by SAP BTP.
