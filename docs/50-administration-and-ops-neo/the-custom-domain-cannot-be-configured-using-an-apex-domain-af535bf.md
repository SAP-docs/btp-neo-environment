# The Custom Domain Cannot Be Configured Using an Apex Domain

Apex domains are not supported for custom domains in the SAP BTP, Neo environment. Learn why this is the case and what actions you can take to configure your custom domain in this environment.

The SAP Custom Domain service in the Neo environment does not support apex domains. Apex domains, also known as root domains, do not contain any subdomains. For example, `myshop.com`.

**Next Steps**:

To configure a custom domain, you need to use at least one subdomain. Examples: `www.myshop.com`, `test.myshop.com`, `login.preview.myshop.com`
