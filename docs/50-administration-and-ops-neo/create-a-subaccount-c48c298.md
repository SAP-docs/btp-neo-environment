<a name="task_pdx_hmd_cqb__steps_gds_lmd_cqb"/>

## Procedure

1.  From your global account, choose *New Subaccount*.

2.  Specify a display name.

3.  **Optional:** Enter a description.

4.  Select the *Neo Environment* checkbox.

5.  Choose the desired infrastructure provider and region for your subaccount.

6.  Enter a subdomain for your subaccount. This will become part of the URL for accessing applications that you subscribe to from this subaccount.

    > ### Note:  
    > The subdomain can contain only letters, digits and hyphens \(not allowed in the beginning or at the end\), and must be unique across all subaccounts in the same region. Uppercase and lowercase letters can be used, however that alone does not qualify as a means to differentiate subdomains \(e.g. `SUBDOMAIN` and `subdomain` are considered to be the same\).
    > 
    > The subdomain can't be changed once you have created the subaccount.

7.  **Optional:** If your subaccount is to be used for production purposes, select the *Used for production* option.

    > ### Note:  
    > This does not change the configuration of your subaccount. Use this flag for your internal use to operate your production subaccounts in your global account and systems more efficiently. Your cloud operator may also use this flag to take appropriate action when handling incidents related to mission-critical accounts in production systems.
    > 
    > You can change your selection at any time by editing the subaccount properties. Do not select this option if your account is used for non-production purposes, such as development, testing, and demos.

8.  **Optional:** To use beta services and applications in the current subaccount, select *Enable beta features*.

    > ### Caution:  
    > You shouldn't use SAP BTP beta features in subaccounts that belong to productive enterprise accounts. For more information, see [Important Disclaimers and Legal Information](https://help.sap.com/viewer/disclaimer).

    > ### Note:  
    > Once you have enabled this setting in a subaccount you cannot disable it.

9.  Save your changes.
