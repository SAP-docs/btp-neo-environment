# Working with Environments Using the btp CLI

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to manage runtime environment instances in a subaccount. For example, enable the Cloud Foundry environment by creating a Cloud Foundry org \(environment instance\).

> ### Tip:  
> By default, all commands are executed in the global account you're logged in to. To change this target to a subaccount, use <code>btp target -sa <i class="varname">&lt;my-subaccount-id&gt;</i></code>. See [Set a Target for Subsequent Commands with btp target](set-a-target-for-subsequent-commands-with-btp-target-720645a.md).
