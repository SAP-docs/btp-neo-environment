# Importing an HTML5 Application

You can import HTML5 applications either creating a new application or creating a new version for an existing application.

> ### Note:  
> When you import an application or a version, the version is not imported into master branch of the repository. Therefore, the version is not visible in the history of the master branch. You have to switch to *Versions* in the navigation area.
