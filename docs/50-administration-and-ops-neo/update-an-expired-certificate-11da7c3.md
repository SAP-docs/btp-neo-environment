# Update an Expired Certificate

When the certificate for the custom domain expires or it's about to expire, you can either upload and bind a new certificate based on a new CSR, or upload and bind a new certificate based on an already existing CSR.

It's possible to update an expired certificate by uploading a signed certificate that isn't based on a CSR generated via the `generate-csr` command. However, this procedure requires you to upload a private key from a remote location, which poses a security risk. Also, there's no way to download the uploaded private key. For more information, see [upload-domain-certificate](upload-domain-certificate-bb54abf.md).

Therefore, SAP recommends that you use only certificates that are based on CSRs previously generated via the `generate-csr` command.

## Using a New CSR



## Context

Upload and bind a new certificate to the SSL host to replace the expired certificate by generating a new CSR. If you had configured the certificate using the console client commands, follow the steps:



<a name="loio7b3d0eda8f4149ad83f46d3472687ee8__steps_v5r_21h_j2b"/>

## Procedure

1.  Generate a new CSR by executing the `neo generate-csr` command with the appropriate parameters:

    ```
    neo generate-csr --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com
    --name mynewcert --certificate-distinguished-name "C=BG,O=MyCompany,CN=example.com"
    ```

    For more information, see [Upload a Certificate](configuring-custom-domains-77cf0e6.md#loio55120d899d314e23ab8e33b4b388cea6).

2.  In the command line output, you get the generated new CSR. Copy and send the text to your trusted CA to sign your certificate.

3.  When you receive a signed SSL certificate from the CA, upload it by executing:

    ```
    neo upload-domain-certificate --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com --name mynewcert --location ./certificate.pub
    ```

4.  Execute `neo set-ssl-host` with the `--certificate` parameter.

    ```
    neo set-ssl-host --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com --name mysslhostname --certificate mynewcert
    ```

    The `set-ssl-host` command allows you to unbind the expired certificate and bind the new one to the SSL host in one step. For more information, see [set-ssl-host](set-ssl-host-2956975.md).

5.  To verify that you have configured correctly the new certificate, execute `neo list-domain-certificates`.

6.  After you have made sure that the new certificate is configured correctly, delete the old certificate.

    Run the `delete-domain-certificate` command:

    ```
    neo delete-domain-certificate --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com --name myoldtcert
    ```

    See [delete-domain-certificate](delete-domain-certificate-c3076cc.md).

## Using the CSR of the Bound Certificate



## Context

Some certificate authorities \(CA\) offer to sign an SSL certificate based on the CSR of the already bound certificate. If you choose this option, you don't need to generate a new CSR.

> ### Note:  
> When you update your old certificate this way, you overwrite it with the new certificate.



## Procedure

1.  Run the `display-csr` command to get the CSR of the certificate currently bound to your SSL host:

    ```
    neo display-csr --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com --name mycurrentcert
    ```

    Then, send the CSR to your CA for signing.

2.  When you receive the signed SSL certificate from your CA, upload it by executing:

    ```
    neo upload-domain-certificate --account mysubaccount --user mymail@example.com --host hana.ondemand.com --name mycurrentcert --location ./certificate.pub â€“-force
    ```

    The `--force` parameter allows you to overwrite the old certificate and bind the new certificate in one step. For more information, see [upload-domain-certificate](upload-domain-certificate-bb54abf.md).

    If you don't use the `--force` parameter, you won't be able to bind the certificate to the SSL host.

3.  To verify that the validity of the certificate is updated, execute `neo list-domain-certificates`.
