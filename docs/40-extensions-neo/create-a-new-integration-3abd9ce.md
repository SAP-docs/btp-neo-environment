If you want your extension application to receive notifications from your SAP SuccessFactors system, you need to subscribe this application to a dedicated event. Using the Intelligent Services Center, you create and configure an integration for this specific event.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP SuccessFactors system, and go to the *Intelligent Services Center*.

2.  Search for an event and choose it from the list. The event opens in a dedicated page.

3.  Select an already existing flow or create a new one from the menu on the left.

4.  In the *Activities* section on the right, choose *Integration*. A new dialog opens.

5.  Choose *Create New Integration*.

    -   For the *Destination Type*, choose *REST*. This means that the extension application that will receive notifications by this event is a REST service.

    -   For the *Format*, choose *JSON*. This means that the notifications will be sent to the REST service in a JSON format.


6.  Choose *Create*. The *Create New Integration Services* page appears.

7.  In the *Create New Integration Services* page, in the *Options* tab, enter a name for the new integration and a description. Choose *Next*.

8.  In the *Configure Fields* tab, you describe the JSON schema of the events which will be sent to the extension application REST API. Choose *Next*.

9.  Configure the settings in the *Response Fields* and *Filter* tabs according to your scenario.

    -   For the *Response Fields* tab, see [Using Configure Fields Tab](https://help.sap.com/viewer/60ba370328e0485797adde67aee846a0/LATEST/en-US/441dd33bd9ff4facaa4ccd9d0970408e.html).

    -   For the *Filter* tab, see [Filter and Sort](https://help.sap.com/viewer/60ba370328e0485797adde67aee846a0/LATEST/en-US/e3d79b3999e84ee7aad3e4f243847d3b.html).


10. Choose *Next*.

11. In the *Destination Settings* tab, set the following configurations:

    1.  In the *REST API URL* field, enter the REST endpoint URL of your application that will be called when the event notification is sent.

    2.  In the *Authentication Type* field, select *OAuth*.
    3.  In the *OAuth Configurations* field, select the outbound OAuth configuration you already have form the drop-down menu. See [Create Outbound OAuth Configuration in SAP SuccessFactors](create-outbound-oauth-configuration-in-sap-successfactors-2fcdea4.md).
    4.  In the *OAuth 2.0 with SAML Flow Options* section, in the *SAML Subject NameID Path* field, choose *Browse*.

    5.  Choose the *Associat–µ* field. Expand the *Entity Tree View* and select the field that will provide the value for the SAML Subject NameID. Choose *Change Association to Selected Field*.

    6.  Choose *Next*.


12. In the *Review and Run* tab, choose *Save* and then *Run Now*.
