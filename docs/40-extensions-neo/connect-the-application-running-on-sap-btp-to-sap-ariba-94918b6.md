After you have configured the Single Sign-On \(SSO\), you need to configure the connectivity layer from SAP BTP to SAP Ariba. To do that, you have to use the SAP Connectivity service:

-   It allows applications running on SAP BTP to access securely remote services that run on the cloud or on-premise.

-   It also provides an API that application developers can use to consume remote services.

-   It allows subaccount- or application-specific configuration of application connections via HTTP and Mail destinations.
