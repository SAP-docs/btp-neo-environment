SAML 2.0 \(Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0\) is a version of the SAML standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains. You have to configure your SAP Ariba solution to use your corporate identity provider via SAML 2.0.

> ### Note:  
> You must use SAML 2.0 since both SAP Ariba Solutions and SAP BTP support the SAML 2.0 standard. For further questions on configuring SSO using SAML 2.0, contact your SAP Ariba representative\(s\); you can also request from them a copy of the SAP Ariba Remote Authentication Deployment Guide.
