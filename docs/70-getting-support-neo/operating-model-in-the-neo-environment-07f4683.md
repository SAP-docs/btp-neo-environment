# Operating Model in the Neo Environment

An operating model clearly defines the separation of tasks between SAP and the customer during all phases of an integration project.

> ### Remember:  
> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on **December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
> 
> For more information, see SAP Note [3351844](https://me.sap.com/notes/3351844).

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of the following technology portfolios: application development; process automation; integration; data, analytics, and enterprise planning; artificial intelligence. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, connect entire IT landscapes, and personalize, build and extend SAP applications. This reduces the overall total cost of ownership maintaining SAP landscapes and third-party software across end-to-end business processes.") :arrow_upper_right:.**



Neo environment and its services have been developed on the assumption that specific processes and tasks are the responsibility of the customer. The following table contains all processes and tasks involved in operating the platform and the services and specifies how the responsibilities are divided between SAP and the customer for each individual task. It does not include the operation of systems and devices residing at operational facilities owned by the customer or any other third party, as these are the customer's responsibility.

Changes to the operating model defined for the services in scope are published using the *What's New* \(release notes\) section of the platform. Customers and other interested parties must review the product documentation on a regular basis. If critical changes are made to the operating model, which require action on the customer side, an explicit notification is sent by e-mail to the affected customers.

It is not the intent of this document to supplement or modify the contractual agreement between SAP and the customer for the purchase of any of the services in scope. In the event of a conflict, the contractual agreement between SAP and the customer as set out in the Order Form, the General Terms and Conditions of SAP Cloud Services, the supplemental terms and conditions, and any resources referenced by those documents always takes precedence over this document.

The responsibilities for operating the Neo environment are listed in the service catalog below.
