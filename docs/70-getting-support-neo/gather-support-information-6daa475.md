# Gather Support Information

The Eclipse tools come with a wizard for gathering support information in case you need help with a feature or operation \(during deploying/debugging applications, logging, configurations, and so on\). 



## Context

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**

The wizard collects the information in a ZIP file, which can be later sent to the support team. This way, the support developers can get better understanding of your environment and process the issue faster.



## Procedure

1.  From the Eclipse IDE, choose *Help* \> *Collect Support Information*.

2.  The launched wizard lists the default components to be collected, depending on the tools youâ€™ve installed. If you need the support team to look at specific resources, expand the *Additional Data* section and select the relevant items.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you select *Screenshot*, your currently open Eclipse windows and views are snapped as a picture and added to the ZIP file. Make sure you don't reveal sensitive information.

3.  In the *File Name* field, specify the ZIP file name and location.

4.  Choose *Finish*.




## Next Steps

You can create a support ticket, attach the files to it, and send it to the corresponding support team. For more information, see [Getting Support, Neo Environment](getting-support-neo-environment-fc2bf6a.md).
