# What Is SAP BTP, Neo Environment

SAP BTP, Neo environment is an enterprise platform-as-a-service \(enterprise PaaS\) that provides comprehensive application development services and capabilities, which lets you build, extend, and integrate business applications in the cloud.

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of four technology portfolios: database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly.") :arrow_upper_right:.**

At its core, SAP BTP enables you to do the following:

-   Extend on-premise and cloud solutions

    Personalize and extend your existing applications, regardless of whether they run on-premise or in the cloud, to achieve agility and go to market faster.

-   Integrate on-premise and cloud solutions

    Bring together disparate systems and IT landscapes to streamline your business processes and increase efficiency.

-   Develop new cloud applications

    Create new cloud applications with a small capital investment in software and hardware.


The Neo environment lets you develop HTML5, Java, and SAP HANA extended application services \(SAP HANA XS\) applications. You can also use the UI Development Toolkit for HTML5 \(SAPUI5\) to develop rich user interfaces for modern web-based business applications.

The Neo environment also allows you to deploy solutions on SAP BTP. In the context of SAP BTP, a solution is made up of various application types and configurations created with different technologies, designed to implement a certain scenario or task flow. You can deploy solutions by using the Change and Transport System \(CTS+\) tool, the console client, or the SAP BTP cockpit, which also lets you monitor your solutions. The SAP multitarget application \(MTA\) model encompasses and describes application modules, dependencies, and interfaces in an approach that facilitates validation, orchestration, maintenance, and automation of the application throughout its life cycle.

The Neo environment lets you use virtual machines, allowing you to install and maintain your own applications in scenarios that aren't covered by the platform.
