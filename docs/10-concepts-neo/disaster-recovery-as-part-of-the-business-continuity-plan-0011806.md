# Disaster Recovery as Part of the Business Continuity Plan

The cloud platform disaster recovery \(DR\) plan is part of the overall cloud platform business continuity plan, which includes crisis management and process continuity activities that are triggered by a declared disaster.

## What Constitutes a Disaster?

A disaster is declared by SAP when there is a loss of utilities and services, and uncertainty about whether they can be restored within a reasonable period of time. A disaster can be caused by a natural catastrophe or a man-made incident. As long as the production site has power and is connected to the Internet, itâ€™s not considered a disaster.

## How Is a Disaster Declared?

Emergency incidents are assessed by SAP as part of its business continuity plan and an SAP management member with proper authorization must officially declare a disaster to initiate a disaster recovery plan.

If a disaster is declared, operations are moved to a disaster recovery site based on the process laid out in the business continuity plan.

## Standard Disaster Recovery

SAP can restore productive tenants from backups as soon as practicable in case of a disaster resulting in the loss of the primary production data center.

As the magnitude of a disaster is unpredictable, a region might not be restored in a reasonable time. In addition, a new infrastructure might need to be set up at a different location, which might require the purchase and setup of new hardware. Therefore, we can't guarantee any fixed recovery timelines.
