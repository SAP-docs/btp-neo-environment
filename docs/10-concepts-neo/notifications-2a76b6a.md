# Notifications

Use *Notifications* to stay informed about different operations and events in the cockpit, for example, to monitor the progress of copying a subaccount.

> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment.

The *Notification* icon in the header toolbar provides a quick access to the list of notifications and shows the number of available notifications. The icon is visible only if there are currently notifications.

Each notification includes a short statement, a date and time, and the relevant subaccount. A notification informs you about the status of an operation or asks for an action. For example, if copying a subaccount failed, an administrator of the subaccount can assign the corresponding notification to himself and provide a fix. The other members of this subaccount can see that the notification is already assigned to someone else.

You have the following options:

-   Dismiss a notification.

-   Assign a notification to yourself. It's possible also to unassign yourself from a notification without processing it further.

-   Once you have completed the related action, you can set the status to complete. This dismisses the corresponding notification for everyone else.


You can access the full list of notifications \(also the ones you have dismissed earlier\) by choosing *Notifications* in the navigation area at the region level.
