If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6a2c1ab5a31b4ed9a2ce17a5329e1dd8.html "SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is an integrated offering comprised of the following technology portfolios: application development; process automation; integration; data, analytics, and enterprise planning; artificial intelligence. The platform offers users the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, connect entire IT landscapes, and personalize, build and extend SAP applications. This reduces the overall total cost of ownership maintaining SAP landscapes and third-party software across end-to-end business processes.") :arrow_upper_right:.**

Most commands that are supported by the console client are available as goals in the plugin. To use the plugin, you require a SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment, which can be automatically downloaded with the plugin. Each version of the SDK always has a matching Maven plugin version.

For a list of goals and parameters, usage guide, FAQ, and examples, see:
