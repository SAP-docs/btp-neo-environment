# Maven Plugin

SAP offers a Maven plugin that supports you in using Maven to develop Java applications for SAP BTP. It allows you to conveniently call the SAP BTP console client and its commands from the Maven environment.

> For more information, see SAP Note [3351844](https://me.sap.com/notes/3351844).

> ### Tip:  
> **This documentation refers to SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment. If you are looking for documentation about other environments, see [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/sap-business-technology-platform?version=Cloud) .**

Most commands that are supported by the console client are available as goals in the plugin. To use the plugin, you require a SAP BTP SDK for Neo environment, which can be automatically downloaded with the plugin. Each version of the SDK always has a matching Maven plugin version.
