The keystore console commands are called from the SAP BTP console client and allow users to list, upload, download, and delete keystores. To be able to use them, the user must have administrative rights for that account. The console supports the following keystore commands: **list-keystores**, **upload-keystore**, **download-keystore**, and **delete-keystore**.
