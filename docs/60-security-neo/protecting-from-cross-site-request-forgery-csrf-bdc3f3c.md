If an application connects to a REST service, the corresponding REST service must take measures to protect against CSRF. For REST services implemented on the SAP BTP a CSRF prevention filter may be used in the corresponding REST service. For more information about CSRF protection on the SAP BTP, see [Protection from Cross-Site Request Forgery](protection-from-cross-site-request-forgery-1f5f34e.md).
